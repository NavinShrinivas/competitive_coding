# competitive coding guide

<b>I.REASON(S) FOR MAKING THIS REPO:</b><br>
>1.To track number of problems I have solved and kinda feel good about working on this....basically data that shows my work makes me happy.<br>
>2.to help people(later down the line who wanna get started with cp).<br>


<hr>


<b>II.Path followed by me to reach so far (I am very much still learning): </b><br>
>1.Learnt basic data structures like int,string,arrays.getting comfortable coding in c++.(solve basic problems with no so complex problem solving requirements)<br>
>2.Went to slightly higher stuff like pointers,writing functions.<br>
>3.Learnt about classes(access specifiers),Understood OOPS concepts.<br><br>
>NOT A STEP(BUT IMPORTANT):I then learnt to be able to analyse the time complexity of code...you can't see if your code is fast enough with a scale :o.
if you dint learn this then its like you wanna measure speed of a car without any tool or data.<br><br>
>4.Finally started problem solving in website..I am mainly following "Interview prep" module from harckerrank(https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit) . This is becuase it has each problem seperated by what's used to solve that particular problem.I also look into codeforces when I want challenging problems.<br>
>5.To learn the topics before solving problems based on it on hackerrank, I use the Competetive coder's handbook by "Antti Laaksonen"...also online resources are your best friend to go along with the book.<br>
>6.Going forward I really and looking forward to upping my skills and reaching the ICPC team of my college :).<br>


in the end I inted to use this as a backend data for one of my planned projects
